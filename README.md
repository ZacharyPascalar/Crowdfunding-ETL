# Crowdfunding-ETL
In this project we perform an advandced anaylsis for Independent funding. The company has received a new dataset that contains information about the backers who've pledged to the live projects. Indpendent Funding wants us to perform an ETL process and a data anlysis by using SQL queries. In this porject it's necessary to first extract the data, then transform it and then load it in a SQL database. Important steps are to create an ERD and table schema for creating a new table in the database. At the end we perform a data analysis using SQL queries.

# Summary 
Using Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and PostgreSQL the following tasks were completed:

- Extracted and transformed the data from the large Excel file into four separate CSV files

- Created a PostgreSQL database and tables by using an ERD

- Loaded the CSV files into the database

- Ran SQL queries to generate reports for stakeholders
